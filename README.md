## Inspiration
We were frustrated by how much time was wasted between managing all the different smart device apps, practically negating their benefit. Even worse, not all smart devices can connect to traditional devices.

## What it does
HomeHive offers a unified interface for all your smart devices. It has an chat interface using LLMs which lets users just type or speak their request without mucking around with complicated UI.

## How we built it
We created various mini circuits to replicate real-world home electronics and displays. We developed a server and a client to provide the HomeHive interface for these electronics.

## What's next for HomeHive
Support for more smart devices, integration with products that people use every day.

## To run the app
Make sure to add your Gemini API key to a local .env file
